 * Create a responsive hook we a set of breakpoint names and widths.
 * You can use any valid css units as well as a numbers (for pixels).
 *
 * **NOTE:** The object key order is important! it's assumed to be in order from smallest to largest
 *
 * ```ts
 * const useBreakpoint = createBreakpointHook({
 *  xs: 0,
 *  sm: 576,
 *  md: 768,
 *  lg: 992,
 *  xl: 1200,
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **Watch out!** using string values will sometimes construct media queries using css `calc()` which
 * is NOT supported in media queries by all browsers at the moment. use numbers for
 * the widest range of browser support.
 *
 * @param breakpointValues A object hash of names to breakpoint dimensions
