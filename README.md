## <b>Overview</b>

<p align="left">
  ReacTree is a VS Code extension which visualizes the component hierarchy within a React application, enabling developers to quickly identify the relationships between components. The extension generates a hierarchy tree of React components, displaying the parent-child relationships and how data is passed between components.

## <b>Installation</b>
The ReacTree extension can be easily installed via the <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ReacTreeDev.reactree'>VS Code Marketplace</a>. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or by using the View: Extensions command (Ctrl+Shift+X). Type ‘reactree’ in the search box and select the Install button. VS Code will download and install the extension from the Marketplace.

## <b>Getting Started</b>

After installing the ReacTree extension in your VSCode, a ‘Start Tree’ item will be added to the Status Bar of your VS Code (bottom right). The extension can be launched by clicking on the Start Tree item on the Status Bar or by using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and selecting ReactTree: Show Panel.

## <b>Functionality</b>

 -  After launching the extension, click on the Select File button and select the file you want to serve as the root. The extension generates a hierarchy tree of React components, displaying the parent-child relationships and the data passed between components.
 -  Toggle the tree's nodes to view the component's props. Easily access the component files by clicking the file button, which will direct you to the corresponding file.

</p>

<br/>
<br/>

- Customize the tree by dragging and dropping components to your preferred layout. Easily switch your view to vertical or horizontal with a click of a button. You can also lock your tree in place so you don't accidently move your tree.
